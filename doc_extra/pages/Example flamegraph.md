# Example flamegraph

This is an example flamegraph generated by Incendium.

Flamegraphs are highly dynamic thanks to the `d3` library.
√ùou can click on a horizontal rectangle (which represents a function call)
to zoom in on the rectangle and its descendants.
You can use the search form on the top right to search for a specific function name.


<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/incendium.css" />
<script src="assets/incendium.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/incendium_flamegraph_hkctthqlqhcubcsgrazymmvaldzllxbq.js"></script>

The *Download* link allows you to download the flamegraph as a javascript file.
To draw the flamegraph in a webpage you just have to add an inline `<script>` that references the javascript file.
You don't even need to call any javascript.
The script automatically inserts the flamgeraph just before the script tag.

For the flamegraph to work properly, you must include the `incendium.js` and `incendium.css` in the webpage (the generated javascript code dependes on the javascript in `incendium.js`). While incendium could be changed in order to generate completely standalone javascript, if you want to include several flamegrpahs in the same webpage, including the entire contents of `incendium.js` would be very wasteful.

For example, the flamegraph above was generated by the following HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/incendium.css" />
<script src="assets/incendium.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/incendium_flamegraph_hkctthqlqhcubcsgrazymmvaldzllxbq.js"></script>
```
